## Dataset
### OverView
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.


This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

#### Task 
The task, we are going to perform here is find *optimal model* through **HyperDrive** and **AutoML** and deploy that best model for binary classification 

#### Attributes of the Dataset are                                             
| Attributes     | Labels                                             |

|HyperTension    | 0 indicates no hypertension,1 indactes hypertension|
|Heart disease   | 0 is for No, 1 is for Yes                          |
